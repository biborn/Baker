# Baker

Quick and easy baking of computing environments, powered by ansible.

Just point to a github repo with a baker.yml file, and we do the rest.

```
$ baker bake --repo https://github.com/alt-code/Dazed
ubuntu/xenial64 virtual machine created at C:\boxes\alt-code\Dazed

  To use:
    baker ssh dazed16
```
